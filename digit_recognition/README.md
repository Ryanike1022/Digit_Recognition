# Digit Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a digit recognition model using PyTorch and the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to classify handwritten digits from images.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd digit_recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook `digit_recognition.ipynb` to train and test the digit recognition model. The notebook includes sections for data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which is automatically downloaded and stored in the `data/` directory when running the notebook.
